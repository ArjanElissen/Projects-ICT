    <p style="color: #429F46;"> Benefits of Recycling</p><p>
        Reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators<br>
        Conserves natural resources such as timber, water and minerals<br>
        Increases economic security by tapping a domestic source of materials<br>
        Prevents pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials<br>
        Saves energy<br>
        Supports American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources<br>
        Helps create jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries in the United States<br><br><br>

        Manufacturing<br><br>
        More and more of today's products are being manufactured with recycled content. Common household items that contain recycled materials include the following:
        <br>
        Newspapers and paper towels<br>
        Aluminum, plastic, and glass soft drink containers<br>
        Steel cans<br>
        Plastic laundry detergent bottles<br>
        Recycled materials are also used in new ways such as recovered glass in asphalt to pave roads or recovered plastic in carpeting and park benches.

        Recycling Creates Jobs<br><br>
        EPA released significant findings on the economic benefits of the recycling industry with an update to the national Recycling Economic Information (REI) Study in 2016. This study analyzes the numbers of jobs, wages and tax revenues attributed to recycling. The study found that in a single year, recycling and reuse activities in the United States accounted for:
        <br>
        681,000 jobs<br>
        $37.8 billion in wages; and<br>
        $5.5 billion in tax revenues.<br>
        This equates to 1.17 jobs per 1,000 tons of materials recycled and $65.23 in wages and $9.42 in tax revenue for every ton of materials recycled

    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Drink It company consist of 4 team members.<br>We are Toby, Jeffrey, Mette and Arjan.<br>We are 4 enthusiatic students of the Fontys academy in Eindhoven.
    <br><br><br><h1>Our company</h1> <p>Sometimes you look at the world and consider yourself: What is happening to the earth? <br>There is a lot of pollution these days.
        <br>Tempature is rising and the poles are melting.<br> We need to make a change before it's to late.<br> So we decided to make a product that will reduce the use of plastic.
        <br>After all the earth is our future. So we have to keep it running. <br><br>We stand for change. <br>Something has to happen before it's to late. 
        <br>Every solution to reduce something starts small. So are we. <br>We want to make the world cleaner. <br>Also we want to make people aware that something has to change.<br> Otherwise the effects will be catastrophic.
        <br>And maybe we can save the earth together.
        <br><br>
        Think before you drink!. <br><br>
